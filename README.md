# MHTabBarController

This is a custom container view controller for iOS 5 that works just like a regular UITabBarController, except the tabs are at the top and look different.

You can customize the tab bar's appearance by setting the view positions with Interface Builder or setting the properties declared in the `MHTabBarController-Protected.h` file.
